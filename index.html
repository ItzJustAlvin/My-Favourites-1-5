<h2> ✨ Digital Art ✨</h2>

    <h4 id="para"> I like doing digital art because it fulfills all of what I want. I can undo whatever and still make art. Although it might not be as realistic it's still a start to my art journey! I usually do digital art and then add it to a video or montage and I feel like it's a good use of time. You should try it our for yourself! An app which is perfect and fullfils are blanks is "Ibis Paint X". It has tons of different feautures and is the app i always use!!</h4>
